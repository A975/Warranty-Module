# Warranty-Module
The system is divided into three parts the shed, DLW, and vendor the system allows the shed to lodge a complaint for a part which is in warranty. Depending on the proper information and authenticity, the request is either accepted or rejected by DLW and further vendor is notified time and again through mails that the part repairing has to be done. Three mails are sent every month and further the fourth mail is the warning mail to notify the vendor to complete the task else cost deduction would take place. The project is made in python, javascript, html and CSS.
